      Explain what the following bash command does:
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/goo
      ```
  answer: |
      If the foo directory does not exist, the command will create foo as well
      as a subdirectory called goo.
      If the foo directory exists but the goo subdirectory does not exist, the
      command will create the goo subdirectory.
      If both foo and its subdirectory goo already exist, the command will do
      nothing.

      Assume you wanted to run the previous command also with argument hoo
      instead of goo, i.e.
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/goo
      mkdir -p foo/hoo
      ```
      How could you modify 'mkdir -p foo/goo' to achieve the same result, using
      only six additional characters?
      
  answer: |
      Use bash brace expansion:
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/{goo,hoo}
      ```

      Explain what the following bash command does:
      ```
      n=`cat foo | wc -l`
      ```
  answer: |
      The command counts the number of lines in the file foo and assigns the
      value to a variable named n.
