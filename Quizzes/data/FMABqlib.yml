      Explain what the following bash command does:
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/goo
      ```
  answer: |
      If the foo directory does not exist, the command will create foo as well
      as a subdirectory called goo.
      If the foo directory exists but the goo subdirectory does not exist, the
      command will create the goo subdirectory.
      If both foo and its subdirectory goo already exist, the command will do
      nothing.

      Assume you wanted to run the previous command also with argument hoo
      instead of goo, i.e.
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/goo
      mkdir -p foo/hoo
      ```
      How could you modify 'mkdir -p foo/goo' to achieve the same result, using
      only six additional characters?
  answer: |
      Use bash brace expansion:
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/{goo,hoo}
      ```

  answer: |
      The command counts the number of lines in the file foo and assigns the
      value to a variable named n.

      Please briefly answer the following questions, in your own words.
      Why is DNA considered a "polymer"?
  answer: |
      DNA is considered a polymer because it consists a chain of "building
      block" (in this case: four distinct nucleotides, abbreviated A, C, G, T)
      that are repeated throughout the chain in a specific order.

      What is meant the term "DNA directionality"?
  answer: |
      A double-stranded DNA nucleotides consistes of two strands of nucleotides
      that are arranged in opposite chemical direction of each other: the "top"
      strand has nucleotides placed in 5' to 3' direction, while the "bottom"
      strand has nucleotides arranged in 3' to 5' direction.  Here 5' and 3'
      refer to the numbered carbons in the dexoyribose ring of the nucleotides
      composing the DNA polymer.

      Briefly discuss chemical and biological differences between DNA and RNA.
  answer: |
      Chemically, DNA contains four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and
      thymine) attached to a sugar ring. The sugar ring in DNA is missing an
      oxygen atom (deoxyribo-).  DNA is usually found as a double-stranded
      molecule. RNA on the other hands, has uracil instead of thymine, and the
      sugar base is (ribo-). RNA is a single-stranded molecule.

      Biologically, DNA is responsible for coding the sequence of the resulting
      pre-mRNA following transcription. Mature mRNA derived from protein-coding
      genes determines the sequence of amino acids in the translation product.

      Assume "TTACATCGA" represents a doublestranded DNA molecule in standard
      notation.  Does the molecule contain the submolecule 5'-ATG-3'?
      What about 5'-CGT-3'?
  answer: |
      5'-ATG-3'occurs in the lower strand of the sequence, opposite CAT in the
      given sequence.  There is no 5'-CGT-3' on either strand.

      For the DNA sequence ACGCTGA, determine the number of mononucleotide
      permuations.
  answer: |
      The number of mononucleotide permutations is
        7! / (2! 2! 2! 1!)  =  (7 * 6 * 5 * 3)  =  42 * 15  =  630.

      Can you find additional dinucleotide permutations that do not preserve
      the mononucleotide composition?
      Explain in general if and when that might be possible.
  answer: |
      Whenever the original sequence starts and ends with the same letter, then
      there may be alternative solutions starting from an internal node of the
      representative graph.  In this case, CGCTGAC or GACGCTG are examples.

      If your current directory, as reported by `pwd`, is

      `/data/gff3/viridiplantae/`? Provide an answer using an absolute path and
      another using a relative path.
  answer: |
      With an absolute path, the command is `cd /data/gff3/viridiplantae/`. With
      a relative path, the command is `cd ../../gff3/viridiplantae/`.
