      Explain what the following bash command does:
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/goo
      ```
  answer: |
      If the foo directory does not exist, it will create it as well as a subdirectory called goo.
      If the foo directory exists but the goo subdirectory does not exist, it will create the goo subdirectory.
      If both already exist, it will do nothing.

      Assume you wanted to run the previous command also with argument hoo instead of goo, i.e.
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/goo
      mkdir -p foo/hoo
      ```
      How could you modify 'mkdir -p foo/goo' to achieve the same result, using only six additional characters?
      
  answer: |
      Use bash brace expansion:
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/{goo,hoo}
      ```

      It counts the number of lines in the file foo and assigns the value to a variable named n.
