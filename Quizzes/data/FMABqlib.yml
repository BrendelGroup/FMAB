      Explain what the following bash command does:
      ```
      mkdir -p foo/goo
      ```
  answer: |
      If the foo directory does not exist, it will create it as well as a subdirectory called goo.
      If the foo directory exists but the goo subdirectory does not exist, it will create the goo subdirectory.
      If both already exist, it will do nothing.
